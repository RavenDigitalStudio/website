      <h1>Camp Details</h1>
      <p>
        The Rhea Schwartz Camp Shalom has been serving this areas’ Jewish
        youth since 1997. Founded by Rhea and Louis Schwartz and sponsored by
        the Tallahassee Jewish Federation, hundreds of kids have enjoyed this
        awesome summer day camp! Registration to the Rhea Schwartz Camp Shalom
        is now open. The camp is available to children ages 5-13.
        Unfortunately, due to the ongoing covid-19 crisis we will not hold
        Camp Shalom this year. We will update all the information below once
        we have a set schedule for summer 2022.

        Drama, Outdoor games and Music. Healthy snacks and drinks are served
