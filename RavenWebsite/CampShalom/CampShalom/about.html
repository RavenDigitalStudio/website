        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          Camp Shalom was created in 1996 by Rhea and Louis Schwartz, who
          envisioned having a Jewish day camp in Tallahassee. Rhea and Louis saw
          it as a way to get the area’s Jewish children from elementary through
          high school together to enrich their Jewish experience and identity.
          Rhea was the vice president of the Tallahassee Jewish Federation at
          the time and received support from the federation to sponsor the camp.
          Two of their children, Patti Brownstein and Mimi Garcia, along with
          other members of the Jewish community from Temple Israel and Shomrei
          Torah, specifically Wendy Sokolow and Barbara Goldstein, carried out
          their vision. Camp Shalom had its first session during the Summer of
          1997. Until her recent passing in 2019, Rhea sat at the front desk of
          Camp Shalom and greeted campers, parents, and staff while keeping a
          sharp eye on the comings and goings of all. She will be sorely missed.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In honor of Rhea’s vision and many years of service, the camp was
          renamed to <span> The Rhea Schwartz Camp Shalom.</span>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <span> Rhea Schwartz Camp Shalom</span> is housed in a local temple.
          Children from the age of 5 to 11 enjoy a variety of activities each
          day. Children aged 12 and 13 go on daily field trips and engage in
          several service activities in the Tallahassee community. Counselors
          can be entering 9th grade – 12th grade. We also have college students
          as counselors and area coordinators. Infused in all of these
          activities is the appreciation and enjoyment of Jewish culture. Many
          of the children that started as campers are now counselors and year
          after year keep coming back to join another season of camp. We hope
          you will consider us for your kids and spread the word about the Rhea
          Schwartz Camp Shalom!

          <span> story of our founders:</span> Both Rhea and Lou, born in New
          York, moved their family of six children down to Tallahassee, Florida
          in 1968. Lou worked at the Florida State University as a professor in
          Special Education. Rhea received her Doctorate Degree at FSU in Early
          Childhood Education and soon thereafter worked at FAMU as a professor
          in the field. Both were very active in the Jewish Community. Rhea
          served in many leadership roles, president of the Tallahassee Jewish
          Federation, Temple Israel Sisterhood (president at age 80) and
          president of the National Council of Jewish Woman. When they retired,
          they became certified Leon County Court Mediators as well as mediators
          for parents with special needs children with the Leon County Schools
          and Board. Both were avid readers and researchers and loved to travel.
          They attended as many simchas as they could for every child,
          grandchild, niece or nephew whether it be graduation, recital or any
          other special occasion. They also ensured that each of their children
          and grandchildren had an opportunity to attend an overnight Jewish
          Camp. The family has fond memories of many Shabbat dinners and
          Passover Seders together at their house.
