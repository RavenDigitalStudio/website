        <h1>Camp Details</h1>
        <p>
          The Rhea Schwartz Camp Shalom has been serving this areas’ Jewish
          youth since 1997. Founded by Rhea and Louis Schwartz and sponsored by
          the Tallahassee Jewish Federation, hundreds of kids have enjoyed this
          awesome summer day camp! Registration to the Rhea Schwartz Camp Shalom
          is now open. The camp is available to children ages 5-13.
          Unfortunately, due to the ongoing covid-19 crisis we will not hold
          Camp Shalom this year. We will update all the information below once
          we have a set schedule for summer 2022.
        </p>

        <p>
          Schedule:<br />
          Campers are assigned to groups according to their grade in school.
          Counselors travel with campers to centers for activities. Centers may
          include: Arts and Crafts, Cooking, Sports and Gym, Activity Game Room,
          Drama, Outdoor games and Music. Healthy snacks and drinks are served
          mid-morning. Please provide a dairy lunch for your camper. Lunch
          provides an opportunity for singing and learning Jewish folk songs.
          After lunch, there is a special camp-wide activity that is enjoyed by
          everyone.
